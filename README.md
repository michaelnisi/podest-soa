# Podest-SOA

The service-oriented-architecture behind the Podest podcast app using [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) and [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). Iâ€™ve just modified some CloudFormation [templates](https://github.com/nathanpeck/aws-cloudformation-fargate) by Nathan Peck for now, planning to reimplement this properly with the [CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/).
